              <div class="col-sm-4"><p>Most traditional sanitation programmes provide some form of subsidy to individual families to reduce the cost of building a toilet. This approach is based on the assumption that both the construction and use of toilets depend on private decisions and on hygiene behaviour at the household level. However, this approach normally results in small, step-by-step changes in sanitation coverage, with further improvements becoming steadily more difficult once early adopters and households with higher incomes have installed sanitation facilities.</p></div>
              <div class="col-sm-4"><p>The community-led total sanitation approach encourages people to think about total sanitation and to consider what their communities will be like when it is achieved. It is based on the assumption that the community has the strength and willingness to overcome their problems. It recognises that outsiders may be needed to help the community identity their current situation and the need for improvement; however, the community must want to change</p></div>
              <div class="col-sm-4"><p>
              	The success of the approach depends on the level of involvement of individuals within the communities. Initially, the input of the external facilitators may be high as they work to encourage members of the community to get involved. As the process develops, the need for external facilitation will decrease and eventually end.
